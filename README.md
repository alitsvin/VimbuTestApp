# Vimbu hiring test application

It's a hiring test project for joining the Vimbu team.

It consists of mobile app developed with React Native and simple backend on ExpressJS.

I choosed ExpressJS for backend because it's a simple technology that is used in Vimbu project.
Mobile app is written on bare React Native because it's more familiar to me and provide more flexibility in developing an application and using 3rd party libraries.

## Launching the project

### Backend
I assume that [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) is already installed.
Run from *backend* folder:
```
node app.js
```

Backend app takes data from json file and can return set of instructors or just one instructor by id.

### Mobile app
To launch mobile app you need follow [React Native guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)
Then from mobile folder:
```
yarn install
npx pod-install
yarn start
npx react-native run-ios
```

I decided to use Vimbu design from promo fideo in LinkedIn since it satisfy the requirements of the task and could be a good start point in developing an app.

I've also recorded a video of the app. It available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P7-TJ8T9TdiLdiAsx7UrV562GqiugVmr/view?usp=sharing).
